# Predicting-Solubility-From-Attributes-of-a-Molecule-s-Structure

Developed a machine learning system to predict aqueous solubility from molecular descriptors, evaluating models with rigorous parameter tuning.

Utilized Python with TensorFlow and scikit-learn for feature scaling, outlier detection, and model performance visualization to enhance accuracy.

Gained expertise in regression techniques, model optimization, and interpretability, with Neural Networks outperforming others in capturing complex data patterns.
